# Jet Set Radio Future RPG

It's almost like a Star Wars RPG, but with a good theme! Pick your character and spray graphiti until they burn out! Your character will get stronger the more experience with spraying they have, but beware some of the character have very strong counter attacks!

## What this game is under the covers

This game was programmed in order to acquire an understanding of object orientation, basic jQuery, and some flexible layout methods. It was initially a challenge to figure out the best way to programatically control and create, add, and remove DOM elements, but this project has expanded my knowledge of these subjects greatly.
